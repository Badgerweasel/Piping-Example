# Piping Example
 A program done for my Operating Systems class to demonstrate an understanding of piping

This program is able to take in linux commands as input from the user and execute them.

In order to run this program use the makefile and then run pipes.x. At that point you should be able to use linux commands and the program will begin executing them. To quit use Ctrl-c.
